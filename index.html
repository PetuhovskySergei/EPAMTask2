                        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever
                        since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
                        and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived
                        not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
                        typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised
                        in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
                        Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
                        software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

                    <div class="main-text-item-text">It is a long established fact that a reader
                        will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking
                        at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a
                        more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using
                        'Content here, content here', making it look like readable
                        English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors
                        now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for
                        'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.
                        Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by
                        accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

                        is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical
                        Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard
                        McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
                        looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a
                        Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in
                        classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum
                        comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et
                        Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45
                        BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular
                        during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum
                        dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

                        Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration
                        in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't
                        look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage
                        of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything
                        embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum
                        generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as
                        necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.
                        It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a
                        handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which
                        looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always
                        free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words
                        etc.
